I had great 10 months in that company & I learnt so much about the industry.Unfortunately I was let go as part of a company wide cost cutting effort. There were 2 layoff in 3 months. About 40% of the employees were laid off beacuse of it.I survide the first but I wan't fortunate enough in the 2nd. 

But I learnt a lot while working there,I am confident that those skills will surely help me in this position and I 'm really excited to learn more about it.

After I laid off, I was having a month severence,that time really allowed me to not only recharge myself ,also it gave me the ability to spend some time to upskill my week points. I worked on various small projects , did some courses & learnt new concepts. I became more active on linkedIn, made new connections & revived old ones.Then I found this position in your company & I thgt it really speaks to my strengths and where I'd like to pick back up with my career.

I am so glad u asked me that.In my last job, I had the opportunity to delve more into theoretical aspests of a developer.But now after doing a lots of personal projects, I am very much interested to work in real time project. Because thats where the real deal lies.I know that this role, based on title & description, would give me that opportunity.
